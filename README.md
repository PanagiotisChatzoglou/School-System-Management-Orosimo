## 📌 About This Project

Orosimo is a complete **school management system** designed to streamline day-to-day operations for educational institutions. It includes role-based access for administrators, staff, and students, and provides modern tools for managing attendance, scheduling, messaging, and more.

This project was originally developed as a **commissioned software solution** for private educational organizations. As part of my vision to contribute back to the developer community and empower other educators, I’ve decided to **open-source the codebase** for learning, collaboration, and further innovation.
